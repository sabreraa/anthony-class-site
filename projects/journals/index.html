        <h1>Journals</h1>
        <h2> Website is a Shifting House</h2>
        <p>
            I relate to the students that ask themselves questions about how to make a website because, to be honest, it can be anything. For me, it helps to have a definitive definition, topic, theme, or direction when it comes to a website, but after reflecting on this reading, I learn that it can be anything you create. It is very flexible, where you can add as many files and whatever file of the information you want. It is similar to an ecosystem, where files make up the website.

        <h2>A Rant on Technology</h2>

        <p>
             I had trouble understanding this reading, I didn't know what it was going for, and there were phrases that I was not familiar with, like hard and soft science fiction. The author explained that soft science fiction is psychology, emotions, and squashy stuff, which are her interest. But I assume that there is plenty of technology that revolves around psychology and emotions, and even affects our psychological and emotional mental state

        <h2>A Handmade Web</h2>
        <P>
            I see what the author means by “handmade web”, it is coded by hand by an individual, in contrast from a corporation or business using a software. I think this reading is a handmade website as well, it looks similar to the coded website we have created in class. I see the value in handmade websites because of the manual labor and effort that is put into it.

        <h2>A Friend is Writing</h2>
        <P>
            I was a bit confused at first because it seemed like a blank page. While on the righthand side, there were colorfull pop ups with texts in them. Then I realized those words popping up was the writting itself. It was an interesting website indeed.

        <h2>The Web's Grain</h2>
        <P>
            I did not expect to hear that unsettling audio at the beginning of the website. It said that it was worth it and that I would get a warm and pleasant feeling in my chest. I did not... obiously he was being sarcastic. It was indeed an irritating beeping sound from a Windows dial-up dialog box form 1995. He went later on a rant about Apple's website sctructure. They do, indeed, have glitchy pages when they present their products in a animated form, which moves while you scroll down or up. I like how simple and clean it looks, it is so cool to control the animation with the tip of your fingers. But it does have its problems, it lags and the animation is too much for our devices, where the fans starts to spin creating so much noise.
