                First introduced in 1957, the legendary Skyline was originally built by Japan's Prince Motor Company. It lasted from 1957 until 1966, when Nissan merged with Prince. With humble origins as a modest 4-door luxury car, the Skyline evolved into a performance sportscar. Today the Skyline is most recognized as the influential predecessor to the modern GT-R (Grand Turismo Racing).</p>
